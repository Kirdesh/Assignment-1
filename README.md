# Your Project's Name

This is my personal portfolio. In this e-portfolio I have written down some things about myself for example which school I go to, which course I take, what I want to do as a future job and many more
I have also talked about what inspired me to take up immersive media in Ngee Ann Polytechnic and just more about me in general like what i like to do in my free time and what i have achieved. 
The reason why I talked about myself a lot is because i wanted the people who were reading my portfolio to know me a bit better so they wont just judge me based on my work but also my personality.
Other than writing about myself, i have also added places to showcase my artwork or programming work. you can find out what i have done and more about the artwork there. However i have only added 
projects that i have done in semester 1 of my first year in poly. i am planning to update the portfolio once i am done with the projects that i am currently doing or will be doing in the future.
and lastly i have added a contact area where you can either chat with me or if u like my work a lot maybe pay me a bit to do some work for you. These are what is in my website hopefully you will go 
check it out yourself.


## Design Process
 
This website is generaly for everyone to look at my art work whenever they want to so that if they do like my art style they can maybe write to me and ask to collab with them or just talk to someone who
is interested in art and here their opinion on how i can improve myself. However when i do get older i wanted more employers to look at my portfolio to see artwork and see weather they like it and maybe 
i will get hired for a job or as a freelancer would also be fine

- As another artist, I want to message the person, so that I can get in touch and collaborate with them.

- As a person who is interested in art i want to message the perwon and ask some questions about art, so that i can get to know more and maybe even try it out myself

- As an employee i want to look at the art and find a way to contact them, so that i can see how they have progressed over the years and to see if they are good so that i can hire him.

## Features

### Existing Features

- Contact form - This allows normal viewers to get in touch with me personaly to maybe share ideas or even collaborate with one another, by having them fill out their name, email, and write a message to me about anything.
               - This also allows recruiters or emplyees  to get in touch with me to either hire me or ask me questions so that they can hire me, by having them fill out their company name, company email and write a message
                 to me on why they are wanting to send me a letter

- Responsive navigation - This allows everyone to go to their chosen part of the portfolio quickly without scrolling through the website, by having options that the user can press to skip to the page that they want to be in

- Portfolio overlay - This allows the user to read what the artwork that i have posted is about and know more about it, by just placing their mouse over the picture of choice

### Features Left to Implement

-  Responsive portfolio - this would allow the users to not only have an overlay when they hover over it it will also allow them to click on the artwork and it would bring them to a new page where it will give amore in depth 
   explanation to the drawing and also a short timelapse on how i made the artwork, by clicking on an artwork they like. 

- Live message - This will allow users to see weather i am online or not and if i am online, they can message me and i will be able to message them back immediately this would feel more personal, and this can be done by looking 
  at a icon seeing if i am online and if i am online there will be a box in the corner of the screen where you can type a message to me.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    3. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that the page reloads

2. Navigation system:
    1. Click outside the navigation icon and verify that nothing happens
    2. Click on thee navigation icon and verify that a overlay appears from the side
    3. Click outside the four navigation options verify that nothing happens
    4. Click on the four navigation options and verify that it goes to its appropriate location
    5. Click on the cross icon in the overlay and verify that the overlay goeas away

3. Hover over portfolio:
    1. hover over each of the art work and verify that an overlay appears with the appropriate arts description on it


My portfolio has flex boxes that will wrap when the screen gets smaller and when the is less than or eaqual to 900px in width, the image on the about me page will disappear because there isn't enough space in the 
page for both the image and words. Not only that they will have the same navigational system and the scroll would all be the same however since a phone user cannot hover a mouse over an artwork to look at it's 
description, they will have the option to click on the image to view the description.


Some of the issues that i encountered were the integration of the navigational system as i did not know how to properly intgrate it. I had some spelling issues. When i was writing the code to overlay on the 
artwork only, i had some difficulties there.
