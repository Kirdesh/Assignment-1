	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>Student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic</h2>
	<p>I am in the school of Infocomm Technology taking the Immersive media course which is a new course that they started in the year 2020. You may ask why I chose this course. Well there is 
		an easy answer to that. I always loved gaming, CGI and VFX since young I was always intrigued on how the movies accomplished those kind of effect in a live action movie. I got inspired mainly by 
		Transformers, Pacific Rim, multiple Marvel movies and many more. Thus I searched up on which schools and courses helps me to get closer to my goal of being a CGI artist and I found immersive media  
		it allows me to have a bit of programming knowledge, teaches me the bascics of drawing and most importantly, how to 3D model. Well if you still decided to stay why not take a look at my progreesion on the next part!
